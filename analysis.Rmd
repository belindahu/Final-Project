next steps: 
- make a map of most common type of startup by state
- top 3 types of startups by state
- make this interactive

todo:
- investments over time: fix y axis
- investments over time by industry: fix y axis
- worldwide vs. in the US
- total funding in cities vs. income
  - do this by industry
- choose top 4 cities
- reformat axes
- add in states
